Another great example of Google is their Image Recognition capabilities. Google makes use of their own Inception V4 and Inception ResNet for its state-of-the-art Image Recognition features.[\/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image=&#8221;14728&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3>FACEBOOK<\/h3>\n<p>With roughly 350 Million photos being uploaded to Facebook daily, it\u2019s clear that intelligent analysis of this data is paramount.
