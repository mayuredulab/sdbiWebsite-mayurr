It has matured over time, with more accurate and localized results for countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chat GPT is a new product that provides simple and clear answers in an easy-to-read format. It provides simple answers more concisely. Chat GPT knows nothing about a data model limited to 2021. This means that Chat GPT doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening in 2023.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chat GPT cannot compare messages with other complete or recent messages because it does not have access to the Internet. So the knowledge about Chat GPT is limited. It is only accessible during training<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chat GPT is currently free to use, but Open AI will monetize it sooner or later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAfter all, creating responses to text requests requires a lot of resources. When Elon Musk asked the CEO of OpenAI, Alex Altman replied that each request costs about a penny.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google is a search engine and does not have the same language processing capabilities as ChatGPTA. I told you earlier that ChatGPTs main appeal is its human interaction. Google does not give you a single answer but gives you a different result and leaves it up to the user to answer as accurately as possible.if you\u2019re new in any profession if you read a couple of various types of articles &amp; blogs then you get the idea about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While googling \u201cyou\u2019re boss of yourself\u201d because is in your hands<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0In contrast, ChatGPT provides comprehensive and clear answers to your questions in human language.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ChatGPT admits that it occasionally provides incorrect answers. This may seem like a minor error, but it means a lot. If you doubt the validity of ChatGPT, you should look elsewhere for awesome information.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google is also useful for certain types of questions, as it searches the web and returns a brief but concise answer right in line. For example, if you search &#8220;Apple stock ticker&#8221; or &#8220;Cheap flights to Aruba,&#8221; it will display a ticker chart with current price information, or a calendar with the most likely cheapest days to fly and a dialogue box that connects you to multiple web sites to shop for tickets on your chosen date. ChatGPT does not search the internet in real time and has only been trained on data up to 2021, making it completely useless for these types of queries.<\/span><\/p>\n<h5><b>Reasons why people stay away from Chat GPT<\/b><\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No Source for the Result Text-Only Result<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slow No Query Suggestions Factual Errors\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">User sometimes can&#8217;t search for products which aren&#8217;t connected to the internet at all<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks in part to its hegemony with Apple (which permits it to be the default search engine on iOS with hefty payments every year in a deal under scrutiny by the US antitrust), Google search has been winning across all platforms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, Google provides multiple results for each query and allows users to select relevant information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Google uses sophisticated algorithms to index and rank web pages that provide accurate and relevant results<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google is also extremely dependable, owing to the company&#8217;s large operations budget and years of experience. ChatGPT is still in beta testing and occasionally goes down.The strength of ChatGPT comes in its awareness of human language and ability to produce a response based on millions of pages of text.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google is a multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products. It provides search engine, online advertising technologies, cloud computing, software, and hardware solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ChatGPT is an AI language model developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning to generate human-like text responses. It is capable of answering a wide range of questions and generating text for various applications, including conversation, summarization, and language translation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h6><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summary, Google is a technology giant that offers a range of products and services related to the internet, while ChatGPT is an AI language model that can generate human-like text for various use cases.<\/span><\/h6>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hey\u2026you yes! \u00a0Do you believe if I say that artificial intelligence is 1 million\u00a0 users in one day?
