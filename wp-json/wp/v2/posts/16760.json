More than 80% of business executives are accelerating plans to digitize and deploy new technologies;\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50% of employers are expecting to accelerate the automation of some roles in their companies. In contrast to previous years, job creation is now slowing while job destruction is accelerating.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_separator color=&#8221;mulled_wine&#8221; style=&#8221;shadow&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16776&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; add_caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After years of growing income inequality, concerns about technology-driven displacement of jobs, and rising societal discord globally, the combined health and economic shocks of 2020 have put economies into freefall, disrupted labour markets and fully revealed the inadequacies of the markets. Millions of individuals globally have lost their livelihoods and millions more are at risk from the global recession, structural change to the economy and further automation. Some 43% of businesses surveyed indicate that they are set to reduce their workforce due to technology integration, 41% plan to expand their use of contractors for task-specialized work, and 34% plan to expand their workforce due to technology integration.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_separator color=&#8221;mulled_wine&#8221; style=&#8221;shadow&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16772&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; add_caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; alignment=&#8221;right&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_shadow_3d&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By 2025, employers will divide work between human and machines equally. Roles that leverage human skills will rise in demand. Machines will be primarily focused on information and data processing, administrative tasks and routine manual jobs for white- and blue-collar positions.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16768&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; add_caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_shadow_3d&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The research also indicated that a growing number of people are making career changes to entirely new occupations. According to LinkedIn data gathered over the past five years, some 50% of career shifts into data and artificial intelligence are from different fields. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That figure is much higher for sales roles (75%), content creation and production positions, such as social media managers and content writers (72%), and engineering roles (67%).<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to The Future of Jobs Survey, core skills such as critical thinking, analysis, and problem-solving are consistently top of the reskilling and upskilling priorities for educators and businesses.

Those wishing to expand their skills in product development and data and artificial intelligence could do so in two to three months, and those switching into cloud computing and engineering could make headway in the new skillset through a four to five-month learning program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has been a fourfold increase in the number of people seeking opportunities for online learning under their own initiative, a fivefold increase in employers offering their workers online learning opportunities, and a nine-fold enrolment increase in people accessing online learning through government programs.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_separator color=&#8221;mulled_wine&#8221; style=&#8221;shadow&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h6><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the economy and job markets evolve, 97 million new roles will emerge across the care economy, in fourth industrial revolution technology industries like artificial intelligence, and in content creation fields. There will be a surge in demand for workers who can fill green economy jobs, roles at the forefront of the data, and artificial intelligence economy, as well as new roles in engineering, cloud computing, and product development. For those workers set to remain in their roles in the next five years, nearly 50% will need reskilling for their core skills.<\/span><\/h6>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_text_separator title=&#8221;SDBI&#8221; color=&#8221;juicy_pink&#8221; style=&#8221;shadow&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h6>Inspiration Source: World Economic Forum Report<\/h6>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;] \u201cCOVID-19 has accelerated the arrival of the future of work,\u201d said\u00a0Saadia Zahidi, Managing Director, World Economic Forum.
