Japan, as a \u2018trilateral power\u2019 has long been regarded as an honorary member of the Western world but her geographic position, culture and economic interests make her a major component of Asia, leading to rapid development of her historic relations with India. They are natural partners, with an economic complementarity that is potentially quite high. Being burdened with a mature economy, an aging population, and a low birth rate, Japan is in need of a growth scenario. In developing such a scenario, it will be important for Japan to expand its relationship with India, which is continuing to grow rapidly.<\/h6>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_separator color=&#8221;mulled_wine&#8221; style=&#8221;shadow&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]There are abundant decent job opportunities for IT specialists in Japan where the new &#8216;Society 5.0&#8217; is being sought after in the coming decades.\u00a0 Japan is the fastest growing nation and suffers from huge shortage of manpower in general and most seriously in the IT sector in particular. Japan will face a shortage of 6.44 million workers by 2030. Tokyo, capital of Japan, alone will be short of 1.33 million workers. The sudden demand has been spurred by the arrival of quick technological innovations to Japan\u2019s societal needs. The Land of the Rising Sun is eager to plug this gap and turn to India for assisting their country in IT and Data Science domain.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16937&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; add_caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_shadow_3d&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16934&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; add_caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_shadow_3d&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Data scientists work in a wide variety of industries. But what they have in common is that it is a profession to solve business problems with advanced data analysis technology. Big data analyzed by data scientists is held and collected by companies. With the evolution of technology, it has become possible to collect information that could not be learned before, and to manage a large amount of data that had been abandoned, so it became possible for each company to collect a huge amount of data.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]Data scientists who gather these vast amounts of inconsistent data and gain insights into company performance have become an important occupation in today\u2019s world where data is being valued.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_separator color=&#8221;mulled_wine&#8221; style=&#8221;shadow&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16935&#8243; img_size=&#8221;large&#8221; add_caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_shadow_3d&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]The \u201cSurvey Report on Latest Trends and Future Estimates of IT Human Resources\u201d published by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan predicted that there was a shortage of human resources related to \u201cbig data\u201d or \u201cIoT intelligence\u201d of about 48,000 people in 2020. The average annual income of data scientists in Japan is said to be at least about 6 million yen a year or more, depending on the size of the company, the length of the service, and the type of work. Compared to other occupations, it is expensive, and as the number of companies that value data increases, the annual income is expected to increase further.[\/vc_column_text][vc_separator color=&#8221;mulled_wine&#8221; style=&#8221;shadow&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]The union cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved a memorandum of cooperation between India and Japan on January 6, 2021 that would facilitate movement of skilled professionals between both Asian countries.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16936&#8243; img_size=&#8221;medium&#8221; add_caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; alignment=&#8221;right&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_shadow_3d&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]Under this framework, Indians will be granted a new status of residence \u2018Specified Skilled Worker\u2019 by the Japanese government.

Shinzo Abe, in his book, Utsukushii Kuni E (Toward a Beautiful Country), expressed his hope that it would not be a surprise if in another 10 years, Japan-India relations overtake Japan-U.S. and Japan-China relations.<\/h6>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"background: white; margin: 0in 0in 19.2pt 0in;\"><span style=\"color: #3e3e3e;\">Furthermore, a data scientist with great expectations is demanded both in Japan and overseas.
