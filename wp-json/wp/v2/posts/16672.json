Data science, in simpler terms is converting or extracting the data in various forms, to knowledge, so that the business can use this knowledge to make wise decisions and make improvements. Whereas Engineering is a structured approach to design, develop and maintenance of software, to avoid the low quality of the software product.<\/h4>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h5>Let\u2019s start with a simple observation,<\/h5>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16674&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; add_caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_shadow_3d&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]The software design made by an engineer is based on the requirements identified by Data Engineer or Data Scientist. So, it is safe to say that data Science and engineering in a way go hand-in-hand. The rapid growth of Big Data acts as an input source for data science, processing and analyzing that data is a huge task that has become mandatory for every[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]business to make an informed decision. An engineer builds applications and systems, are involved in all stages of this process from design to writing code, to testing and review but at the end of the day, they need Data Scientists to extract a hidden pattern out of it and build an analysis.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16675&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; add_caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_shadow_3d&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column][vc_separator color=&#8221;mulled_wine&#8221; style=&#8221;shadow&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16676&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; add_caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_shadow_3d&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]You can almost guarantee that every engineer will consistently come into contact with data, no matter the engineer\u2019s focus. It\u2019s vitally important that the average engineer is sufficiently competent at gathering good data and properly interpreting its meaning. If you are an engineer who wants to break the barrier and switch successfully to data science[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text]you need to have an understanding about the statistical tools and techniques needed to extract insightful information, trends and patterns from data.

They have an in-depth understanding about different data systems while diagnosing results of experiments and implementing the data products. Software Engineers and IT Engineers have prior[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]experience in data cleaning and detecting inconsistencies within the datasets, this is a valuable skill for a data scientist to arrive at accurate and effective decisions. Some companies require their employees to take up various roles includes experimentation, building models, developing insights and software engineering. This would be a perfect opportunity for a data scientist who is also a good engineer. In this ever-changing world, understanding of mechanics\/statistics to choose the right features and model to predict the answer of a complex problem is almost impossible to solve with a pure analytical study, hence Data Science has become the new age Engineering.[\/vc_column_text][vc_separator color=&#8221;mulled_wine&#8221; style=&#8221;shadow&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16679&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; add_caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_shadow_3d&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][vc_separator color=&#8221;mulled_wine&#8221; style=&#8221;shadow&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16680&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; add_caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_shadow_3d&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text]The Big Data industry is seeing an all-time high in career growth and job demand.
