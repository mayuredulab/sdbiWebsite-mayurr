Having built empathy with the customers and gaining an understanding of the reasons for their behaviors, businesses can then define the nature and extent of their problems more concretely.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16920&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_shadow_3d&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]Once the information is synthesized to identify patterns, key insights that emerge from this process can be combined with well understood theory of how the world works with unexpected findings from the design research.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_separator color=&#8221;mulled_wine&#8221; style=&#8221;shadow&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]The clear definition of user needs enables the formation of one or more hypotheses that serve as starting points for innovative designs that address those needs in new or unexpected ways. Businesses uses data science as a critical tool for evaluating the quality of the hypotheses that they develop by being systematic about data acquisition and analysis, so that hypotheses can be directly tested against quantitative evidence to establish their comparative strengths and prioritize them accordingly.[\/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16921&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; add_caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_shadow_3d&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]The next stage is prototyping stage where the concepts come to life. Sketching out mockup screens and product features, building user journeys and interactive prototypes, developing business models and product roadmaps to maximize product uptake and revenue. Prototypes undergo extensive iteration to ensure that they have fully addressed the insightful points uncovered during research. In design research projects, it is critical that the prototypes being developed solve the most important problems, and in the right order.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16922&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; add_caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_shadow_3d&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]The behavioral model can be queried to ensure this is the case and to guide the improvement of the user journey. The product roadmap should \u00a0include a targeted data acquisition strategy, enabling more sophisticated functionalities to be validated by user interactions before being deployed more widely and lastly comes the testing stage, for a design projects, the concept of a \u201ctest and learn\u201d loop is useful to emphasize the iterative and ongoing nature of product refinement and improvement.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]While there are classes of models that work well for small groups of users given sufficient domain knowledge, all data science techniques work better at scale. Data science provides the means to measure and compare our designs in an unbiased way. This can be done at different levels of design fidelity and at different resolutions of the model, from the granular feature level all the way up to the level of the overarching system, depending on the resources available for prototyping and testing design elements.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_separator color=&#8221;mulled_wine&#8221; style=&#8221;shadow&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;16923&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; add_caption=&#8221;yes&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css_animation=&#8221;fadeIn&#8221;]By carefully interweaving design thinking, strategy and data science, businesses can achieve design solutions that are not only conceptually and experientially outstanding, but that will also succeed in the marketplace. At the end of the day, the organizations that would win will be the ones that learn how to leverage Data Science and Design Thinking to drive the business and operational focus, and align, adopt and monetize these enabling technology combinations.\u00a0The principles of the design process or design thinking, can help get the most out of data science, by providing a methodology for dealing with the ambiguous and complex nature of the data science models. It can also help in ensuring that the resulting insights are actionable and valuable for stakeholders, who remain at the core of the process.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_separator][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_text_separator title=&#8221;SDBI&#8221;
