This deal has raised concerns of net neutrality and data privacy as the enormous amounts of data (WhatsApp, now has over 400 million users and Jio has about 390 million telecom subscribers in India) will be collected by these entities.

In the net neutrality debate, one of the issues raised was that of telecom companies, deliberately reducing the data speeds of some players while giving faster speeds to others.[\/vc_column_text][vc_separator color=&#8221;mulled_wine&#8221; style=&#8221;shadow&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text]The second issue pertains to charges, i.e. access to some websites are free, while some are being charged.
