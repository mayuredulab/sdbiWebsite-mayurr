I was never a fanatic or a pedantic with the things I liked, they\u2019d all get monotonous at some point. Things changed when my father introduced me to Artificial intelligence, so I share credit with him for my crazy obsession.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cPredicting the future isn\u2019t magic, it\u2019s artificial intelligence.\u201d<br \/>\n<strong>\u2013 Dave Waters <\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions, crazy right so it\u2019s basically a human brain minus the human error. Most people think of AI as robots, that\u2019s because all the movies and novels depict AI as robots that could wreak havoc on earth, that\u2019s actually far from the truth, AI is simply designed to understand and mimic human actions, responses for efficient problem solving.<\/p>\n<p>Today AI is used in almost every sector of life from Banking to Healthcare providing advancement in these fields. Social media, which I\u2019m sure most of you are aware of uses Artificial intelligence to curate the contents as per our interests and filters out the friend suggestions, even Clickbait! Other basic applications of AI are self-driving cars, GPS, Cortana, Siri Amazon Echo. The current AI is the narrow or the weak AI which is used for basic simulations, the general AI is designed to perform every cognitive task. The third and the coolest AI is the ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) which is an aspect of intelligence which is more powerful and sophisticated than a human\u2019s intelligence. ASI will outperform the human brain and will be able to generate responses and answer questions which might be beyond us humans.<\/p>\n<p>AI has grown exponentially in the past decade, and so have the career opportunities as an AI expert\/specialist. The basic skills required to build a career in AI are Sound Mathematical and Algorithmic Understanding, Basic Know-How of Programming Languages, Robotics, Data science and machine learning.<\/p>\n<p>But like the famous American idiom, every coin has two sides AI might be a threat if it&#8217;s designed in the destructive manner. Building autonomous weapons using artificial intelligence are basically systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could easily cause mass casualties. AI could be programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive method for achieving its goal: This can happen whenever we fail to fully align the AI\u2019s goals with ours, which is strikingly difficult.<\/p>\n<p>The above points paint a hazy picture as to what AI could really have in store in the future. But one can definitely say that AI is a violent delight.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most people think of AI as robots, that\u2019s because all the movies and novels depict AI as robots that could wreak havoc on earth, that\u2019s actually far from the truth, AI is simply designed to understand and mimic human actions, responses for efficient problem solving.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":16550,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false},"categories":[62],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.0.1 -
