										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s rapidly evolving digital landscape, the world is generating an unprecedented amount of data. This data holds enormous potential to drive innovation, solve complex problems, and improve decision-making processes. As such, there is a growing need for skilled professionals who can extract valuable insights from this data &#8211; enter the data scientist. Data scientists possess the unique ability to analyze, interpret, and communicate data-driven findings, making them indispensable assets in our increasingly data-driven world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world needs more data scientists, including women, to harness the growing volume of data and unlock its potential across various industries. As mentioned earlier, data scientists play a crucial role in analyzing, interpreting, and communicating valuable insights from large datasets. By promoting gender diversity and encouraging more women to enter the field, we can ensure a broader range of perspectives and ideas, leading to more innovative and effective solutions. Additionally, having more women data scientists helps reduce biases in data-driven decision-making and contributes to a more equitable and inclusive workforce, ultimately benefiting the diverse world we live in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data science is a fantastic career choice for women, but it can be tricky to get started. The good news is that there are many reasons why women are making great strides in the field. Here’s what we know about why data science is a great career choice for women and how to get started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A growing number of women are becoming data scientists and tech leaders, but they face some serious roadblocks along the way. Here are some of the major issues women face in a male-dominated industry, and strategies they can use to overcome their human resources, business, administration, information technology, marketing, advertising, and sales.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organize datasets and identify meaningful patterns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build algorithms and design experiments to extract data to benefit the wider organization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create clear reports that visualize and communicate data insights in a business</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use machine learning tools and statistical techniques to produce actionable solutions to problems</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use insights to locate business opportunities in various departments, like marketing or HR</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mathematics and computer science are two of the strongest prerequisites for a successful career in data science. Fortunately, there is a growing number of communities for women who want to break into these areas. For example, Women Who Code sponsors women’s coding workshops and support groups throughout the country. At this point, there&#8217;s enough interest in starting these types of spaces that companies such as Google and Facebook have been forced to start their own initiatives to encourage women to pursue careers in data science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17625" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Join-s-to-support-diversity-in-STEM..jpg" alt="" width="1175" height="985" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Join-s-to-support-diversity-in-STEM..jpg 1175w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Join-s-to-support-diversity-in-STEM.-300x251.jpg 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Join-s-to-support-diversity-in-STEM.-1024x858.jpg 1024w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Join-s-to-support-diversity-in-STEM.-768x644.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1175px) 100vw, 1175px" />Female working statistics will continue to rise with more women becoming interested in data science, but still, the number of men coming into the field is greater. The biggest barrier for women entering data science is the perception that this field requires technical expertise in math and computer programming. While there are many specializations and roles within data science, including those that run on hardware, basic statistics can be done using Excel or python</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data scientists work in a variety of industries, including accounting and finance, Women in data science are essential in a data-driven world. We cannot accept large gender gaps where women are underrepresented, especially in industries that promise to change the world in such monumental ways. Women in statistics and data science will help prevent statistical bias, offer unique perspectives, and enjoy the benefits of a high-paying career path with a positive job outlook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data scientists and statisticians are in high demand, but the number of women available for the job is limited. As more and more people are relying on data to make decisions, we need more women working in this field, as they can help prevent bias and offer unique perspectives. The work being done by women in statistics and data science is paramount to achieving any goal.<br />
</span></p>
<h1>Data Science: Where Women Lead the Way to Tomorrow</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of women in data science depends on women who not only occupy roles in the industry but excel in executive roles and leadership positions in the data science and analytics space. Women in data science positions need education and confidence to pursue influential leadership positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversation about women in data science and the gender gap in technology has largely discussed the dangers of male-dominated workplace culture, the lack of mentorship provided to women, and the misconceptions about what it’s like to work in data, however, researchers are now examining how a lack of confidence is a major obstacle for women in statistics and data science.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Why Is Data Science a Fantastic Career Choice for Women?</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17621 alignnone" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Why-is-Data-Science-Fantastic-Career.jpg" alt="" width="746" height="420" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Why-is-Data-Science-Fantastic-Career.jpg 1920w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Why-is-Data-Science-Fantastic-Career-300x169.jpg 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Why-is-Data-Science-Fantastic-Career-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Why-is-Data-Science-Fantastic-Career-768x432.jpg 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Why-is-Data-Science-Fantastic-Career-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" /></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and foremost reasons that come to mind when discussing data science as a positive career choice are the widely heard promises of high pay and job growth. Indeed, looking at the data on Glassdoor (put together by a data scientist, no doubt), Data Scientist salary in India ranges between ₹ 3.6 Lakhs to ₹ 25.0 Lakhs with an average annual salary of ₹ 12.7 Lakhs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data science is a fast-growing field that allows you to work in an analytical role with data as your tool to get insights and solve problems. In this role, you have the privilege of making systems, technologies, and even products based on analysis. A career in data science will provide you with a wide range of opportunities, such as self-driven career growth, working with cutting-edge technology and tools, learning from the best people in different fields, and gaining skills that are applicable to other sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Female data scientists are in huge demand. This is due to the vast number of qualifications women (and men) can gain through data science degrees. There&#8217;s also a distinct image of what you might expect a female data scientist to look like—either a chick wearing hoodies or nerdy glasses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you want to start or progress your career. In this post, I&#8217;m going to explain why being a female data scientist is an ideal choice for you and why it can open up multiple opportunities for success.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.  The field of data science needs you.</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17619 alignright" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Field-of-Data-Science-Needs-You.jpg" alt="" width="411" height="231" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Field-of-Data-Science-Needs-You.jpg 1920w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Field-of-Data-Science-Needs-You-300x169.jpg 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Field-of-Data-Science-Needs-You-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Field-of-Data-Science-Needs-You-768x432.jpg 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Field-of-Data-Science-Needs-You-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px" /></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A new report on the gender balance in this multi-billion-dollar industry released by the Institute for Women and Technology (IWT) and McKinsey &amp; Company shows that data science is making significant progress toward becoming more diverse, but a lack of women persists. More than half of all data scientists are men.  “This is not an anomaly, it’s a systemic problem,” said Diana Frank, senior vice president at McKinsey</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gender imbalance in data science is a growing problem. The field of data science needs more women and since you are here today, you can be part of the solution!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons to become a data scientist, but the main one is that it&#8217;s a fantastic way to further your education and career in your field of interest. The skills that you learn while becoming a data scientist can help you break into any field possible. Data science proves itself as a highly lucrative career choice for women who dare to take it on and achieve success in this male-dominated industry.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Women’s Biggest Barriers and How to Overcome Them</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17622 alignleft" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Women-Biggest-Barrierss.jpg" alt="" width="527" height="297" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Women-Biggest-Barrierss.jpg 1920w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Women-Biggest-Barrierss-300x169.jpg 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Women-Biggest-Barrierss-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Women-Biggest-Barrierss-768x432.jpg 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Women-Biggest-Barrierss-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also now be experiencing some degree of self-doubt, as is common for women in this situation. Indeed, this doubt remains one of the biggest barriers still preventing or hindering many women from entering the field. But it doesn’t have to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a large industry, where representation is still lagging behind what researchers had expected based on the rapidly increasing number of women entering STEM and related fields, one could say that Women’s Biggest Barriers and How to Overcome Them is a must-read. In fact, many women still face a lot of roadblocks in becoming an ever more prominent force in software development and technology-related fields (engineering, programming). If you are one of them, it’s time to take a step back and look at this book as a platform for growth — not only yours but also for other women who might be interested in learning about coding or pursuing a data science degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the truth is – those are justifications of fear and thus complete nonsense. Our brains are very powerful at making excuses for us all &#8212; even when trying to stick with a new exercise routine or a healthier diet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of us think that we can’t enter or excel at certain careers because of our personal circumstances, including gender and age. But this thinking has no basis in facts or research — in fact, it’s holding women back from seeing their full potential. Our brains are very good at justifying our thoughts and feelings — so instead of letting these barriers get in the way every time we try something new, let’s use them as motivation to overcome doubt and embrace opportunities!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons why women find it difficult to enter the field of Data Science. A lot of barriers can be related to cultural issues, education, and a lack of awareness about the roles available in data science fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women’s biggest barrier to becoming data scientists is the lack of role models in the field. There are so few women that it is hard for them to find role models and mentors, which leads to more discouragement. Women also face issues when their workplace cultures don’t consider them as experts and value their contributions as much as their male colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data science is a field that’s quickly becoming a leading way to solve problems. Data scientists are responsible for evolving the way we do things, whether it’s understanding how people use technology and then figuring out how to make this technology better by learning from them, exploring new ways to analyze information in people’s lives, or even learning from data itself. For example, one of your jobs as a data scientist could be to figure out ways for a company like Facebook to encourage users to use more of its services. We’re using social media—known as the Facebook News Feed algorithm update process—so that we can get the most engagement possible while reducing spammy comments. While there are many types of roles you might end up serving in your career as a data scientist, no matter what type of role you end up playing, there are two skills that every good data scientist should have: analyzing and organizing data.</span></p>

<p>The Indian Premier League<span style="font-weight: 400;">, or IPL, has captured the hearts of millions around the globe. With intense competition and exceptional talent on display, it&#8217;s a cricket tournament like no other. But with so many variables at play, accurately predicting the winner can be a challenging task. That&#8217;s where machine learning comes in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to train computers to learn from data and generate predictions based on that knowledge is known as machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence. These algorithms can analyze historical information such as teams, players, and match outcomes, in the case of IPL win prediction in order to spot patterns and trends that indicate which team is most likely to win.</span></p>
<p><b>Machine Learning Algorithm<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-17563 alignleft" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Machine-learning-algorithm.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="327" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Machine-learning-algorithm.jpg 800w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Machine-learning-algorithm-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Machine-learning-algorithm-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px" /></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The capacity of machine learning to take into account a huge variety of factors that might influence a match&#8217;s outcome is what makes it unique. Machine learning algorithms may consider anything from prior team performances and player forms to pitch conditions and even weather forecasts. This enables predictions that are more precise than those made merely on the basis of human intuition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Data Collection and Cleaning</b></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17564 alignright" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Data-Collection-and-Cleaning.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="149" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Data-Collection-and-Cleaning.jpg 509w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Data-Collection-and-Cleaning-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we have a clean dataset, it&#8217;s time to select the best machine learning method. There are several choices, including logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. The decision is based on the size, complexity, and level of accuracy that are sought for the dataset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After choosing an algorithm, we proceed to train our machine learning model. In order to do this, the data must be split into training and testing sets. While the testing set assesses the model&#8217;s accuracy, the training set teaches the algorithm to recognize patterns and trends. We make the model more accurate until it reaches the target degree of accuracy.</span></p>

Our machine learning algorithm predicts the most probable winning side once we enter the pertinent information, including team names, players, pitch conditions, and even the weather forecast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s crucial to remember that machine learning is not a precise science. The projections will always be subject to some degree of uncertainty. The accuracy is a function of the model&#8217;s complexity, the quality and completeness of the data, and the data itself. The results of matches may also be influenced by additional aspects that the data or the model may not have considered.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s rapidly evolving digital landscape, the world is generating an unprecedented amount of data. This data holds enormous potential to drive innovation, solve complex problems, and improve decision-making processes. As such, there is a growing need for skilled professionals who can extract valuable insights from this data &#8211; enter the data scientist. Data scientists possess the unique ability to analyze, interpret, and communicate data-driven findings, making them indispensable assets in our increasingly data-driven world.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world needs more data scientists, including women, to harness the growing volume of data and unlock its potential across various industries. As mentioned earlier, data scientists play a crucial role in analyzing, interpreting, and communicating valuable insights from large datasets. By promoting gender diversity and encouraging more women to enter the field, we can ensure a broader range of perspectives and ideas, leading to more innovative and effective solutions. Additionally, having more women data scientists helps reduce biases in data-driven decision-making and contributes to a more equitable and inclusive workforce, ultimately benefiting the diverse world we live in.<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17542 alignright" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design.png" alt="The world needs more data scientists, including women,." width="435" height="291" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design.png 960w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design-300x201.png 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design-768x514.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data science is a fantastic career choice for women, but it can be tricky to get started. The good news is that there are many reasons why women are making great strides in the field. Here’s what we know about why data science is a great career choice for women and how to get started.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A growing number of women are becoming data scientists and tech leaders, but they face some serious roadblocks along the way. Here are some of the major issues women face in a male-dominated industry, and strategies they can use to overcome their human resources, business, administration, information technology, marketing, advertising, and sales.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: center;">
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organize datasets and identify meaningful patterns</span></p>
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build algorithms and design experiments to extract data to benefit the wider organization</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create clear reports that visualize and communicate data insights in a business</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use machine learning tools and statistical techniques to produce actionable solutions to problems</span></li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use insights to locate business opportunities in various departments like marketing or HR</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mathematics and computer science are two of the strongest prerequisites for a successful career in data science. Fortunately, there is a growing number of communities for women who want to break into these areas. For example, Women Who Code sponsors women’s coding workshops and support groups throughout the country. At this point, there&#8217;s enough interest in starting these types of spaces that companies such as Google and Facebook have been forced to start their own initiatives to encourage women to pursue careers in data science.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Female working statistics will continue to rise with more women becoming interested in data science, but still, the number of men coming into the field is greater. The biggest barrier for women entering data science is the perception that this field requires technical expertise in math and computer programming. While there are many specializations and roles within data science, including those that run on hardware, basic statistics can be done using Excel or python</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17543 alignleft" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/women-Blog-2.png" alt="" width="408" height="272" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/women-Blog-2.png 1920w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/women-Blog-2-300x200.png 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/women-Blog-2-1024x682.png 1024w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/women-Blog-2-768x511.png 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/women-Blog-2-1536x1022.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data scientists work in a variety of industries, including accounting and finance, Women in data science are essential in a data-driven world. We cannot accept large gender gaps where women are underrepresented, especially in industries that promise to change the world in such monumental ways. Women in statistics and data science will help prevent statistical bias, offer unique perspectives, and enjoy the benefits of a high-paying career path with a positive job outlook.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data scientists and statisticians are in high demand, but the number of women available for the job is limited. As more and more people are relying on data to make decisions, we need more women working in this field, as they can help prevent bias and offer unique perspectives. The work being done by women in statistics and data science is paramount to achieving any goal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">*** The Future for Women in Data Science ***</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of women in data science depends on women who not only occupy roles in the industry but excel in executive roles and leadership positions in the data science and analytics space. Women in data science positions need education and confidence to pursue influential leadership positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversation about women in data science and the gender gap in technology has largely discussed the dangers of male-dominated workplace culture, the lack of mentorship provided to women, and the misconceptions about what it’s like to work in data, however, researchers are now examining how a lack of confidence is a major obstacle for women in statistics and data science.</span></p>
<h6><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Why Is Data Science a Fantastic Career Choice for Women?</span></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and foremost reasons that come to mind when discussing Data Science as a positive career choice are the widely heard promises of high pay and job growth. Indeed, looking at the data on Glassdoor (put together by a Data Scientist no doubt) The national average salary for a Data Scientist is $1,21,314 in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data science is a fast-growing field that allows you to work in an analytical role with data as your tool to get insights and solve problems. In this role, you have the privilege of making systems, technologies, and even products based on analysis. A career in data science will provide you with a wide range of opportunities, such as self-driven career growth, working with cutting-edge technology and tools, learning from the best people in different fields, and gaining skills that are applicable to other sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Female data scientists are in huge demand. This is due to the vast number of qualifications women (and men) can gain through data science degrees. There&#8217;s also a distinct image of what you might expect a female data scientist to look like — either a chick wearing hoodies or nerdy glasses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you want to start or progress your career. In this post, I&#8217;m going to explain why being a female data scientist is an ideal choice for you and why it can open up multiple opportunities for success.</span></p>
<h6><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.  The field of data science needs you.</span></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new report on the gender balance in this multi-billion-dollar industry released by the Institute for Women and Technology (IWT) and McKinsey &amp; Company shows that data science is making significant progress toward becoming more diverse, but a lack of women persists. More than half of all data scientists are men.  “This is not an anomaly, it’s a systemic problem,” said Diana Frank, senior vice president at McKinsey</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gender imbalance in data science is a growing problem. The field of data science needs more women and since you are here today, you can be part of the solution!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons to become a data scientist, but the main one is that it&#8217;s a fantastic way to further your education and career in your field of interest. The skills that you learn while becoming a data scientist can help you break into any field possible. Data science proves itself as a highly lucrative career choice for women who dare to take it on and achieve success in this male-dominated industry.</span></p>
<h6><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Women’s Biggest Barriers and How to Overcome Them</span></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also now be experiencing some degree of self-doubt, as is common for women in this situation. Indeed, this doubt remains one of the biggest barriers still preventing or hindering many women from entering the field. But it doesn’t have to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a large industry, where representation is still lagging behind what researchers had expected based on the rapidly increasing number of women entering STEM and related fields, one could say that Women’s Biggest Barriers and How to Overcome Them is a must-read. In fact, many women still face a lot of roadblocks in becoming an ever more prominent force in software development and technology-related fields (engineering, programming). If you are one of them, it’s time to take a step back and look at this book as a platform for growth — not only yours but also for other women who might be interested in learning about coding or pursuing a data science degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But the truth is – those are justifications of fear and thus complete nonsense. Our brains are very powerful at making excuses for us all &#8212; even when trying to stick with a new exercise routine or a healthier diet.<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-17544 alignleft" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Woman-Blog.png" alt="" width="468" height="468" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Woman-Blog.png 1920w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Woman-Blog-300x300.png 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Woman-Blog-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Woman-Blog-150x150.png 150w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Woman-Blog-768x768.png 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Woman-Blog-1536x1536.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of us think that we can’t enter or excel at certain careers because of our personal circumstances, including gender and age. But this thinking has no basis in facts or research — in fact, it’s holding women back from seeing their full potential. Our brains are very good at justifying our thoughts and feelings — so instead of letting these barriers get in the way every time we try something new, let’s use them as motivation to overcome doubt and embrace opportunities!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons why women find it difficult to enter the field of Data Science. A lot of barriers can be related to cultural issues, education, and a lack of awareness about the roles available in data science fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women’s biggest barrier to becoming data scientists is the lack of role models in the field. There are so few women that it is hard for them to find role models and mentors, which leads to more discouragement. Women also face issues when their workplace cultures don’t consider them as experts and value their contributions as much as their male colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data science is a field that’s quickly becoming a leading way to solve problems. Data scientists are responsible for evolving the way we do things – whether it’s understanding how people use technology and then figuring out how to make this technology better by learning from them or exploring new ways to analyze information in people’s lives, or even learning from data itself. For example, one of your jobs as a Data Scientist could be to figure out ways for a company like Facebook to encourage users to use more of its services. we’re using social media – known as the FB News Feed Algorithm update process – so that we can get the most engagement possible while reducing spammy comments. While there are many types of roles you might end up serving in your career as a data scientist, no matter what type of role you end up playing, there are two skills that every good data scientist should have: Analysing and Organizing Data.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types of Data Science jobs:</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search giant has confirmed that it will soon begin public testing of its new AI chatbot, called Bard based on the company&#8217;s ” Language Model for Conversational Applications (LaMDA)”. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, also discussed the addition of artificial intelligence tools to Google Search. It should be noted that Lambda is currently only being tested in a small number of the company&#8217;s Demo Kitchen app customers. What precisely are BARDs, and why did Google decide to introduce this new technology at such short notice? A talking chatbot named Bard is based on Google and LaMDA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Google makes the experimental AI conversation service more broadly accessible to the public, Sundar Pichai stated that it will be made available to trusted testers in the upcoming weeks.</span></p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s look more closely at the purpose for this declaration.</strong></p>
<p><b>Why has Google announced Bard?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This proclamation must be understood. Microsoft is getting ready to reveal ChatGPT&#8217;s inclusion in its Bing search engine. Days before Google&#8217;s own AI presentation, Microsoft announced a fascinating event. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman poses with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella earlier this month. Microsoft has already made a $10 billion investment in OpenAI this year, and incorporating ChatGPT into Bing will cause significant problems for Google and its primary search operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be true that Google pioneered transformer technology, but it&#8217;s too late to change AI at this point. In many aspects, ChatGPT is referred to as the &#8220;demise of Google Search&#8221; because it can offer AI voice for lengthy articles and occasionally quite elegant user-question responses. Of course, nothing is perfect, but AI needs to learn how to get better and fix errors.</span></p>
<p><b>What is Bard and when can I access it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LaMDA and Google&#8217;s own AI conversational chatbot serve as the foundation for Bard. A conversational chatbot named Bard is built on Google and &#8220;Lambda.&#8221; Before Google makes its conversational AI service more broadly accessible to the public, Pichai is calling it a &#8220;experimental&#8221; service that will be offered to trusted testers in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you are wondering how to sign up for it, Remember that it is not yet accessible to the general public. LaMDA has been under testing for about two years, and Bards release is actually happening much faster than that, given the cautious and methodical approach Google has taken with LaMDA. Bard makes an effort to offer insightful, distinctive responses. In brief, it provides in-depth discussions and responses in the form of essays, much like ChatGPT does currently. The user can ask Bard to explain recent scientific findings from NASA&#8217;s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old youngster or find out more about the top soccer players of the present and then perform drills to develop his skills.</span></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:- </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has stated that it intends to integrate AI capabilities into search results. You can rapidly comprehend the big picture and learn more from other websites, such as blogs, thanks to AI-powered search capabilities that translate complex facts and multiple points of view into easy formats.  Playing the same piano and guitar,   How to locate or incorporate views in topic files. Once more, these functionalities will be available soon. This means that when searching for information on Google in the future you can expect snippets of information gleaned from blogs or articles</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey…you yes!</span></h2>
<h6><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do you believe if I say that artificial intelligence is 1 million  users in one day? It sounds crazy right guys am speaking about OPEN AI (chat GPT)</span></h6>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h6><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix &#8211; 3.4 years</span></h6>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h6><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook &#8211; 10 months</span></h6>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h6><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chat GPT &#8211; 5 days</span></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, many users are now contrasting ChatCPT with Google and expressing their opinions about both services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we&#8217;ll demonstrate the differences between the two systems and how they set themselves apart from their respective services.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is a popular search engine that can answer all of its users&#8217; questions. It should be noted that Google is controlled by millions of writers who write around the clock to look up any information</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google offers several ways to find the best match.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has a huge database with all the latest information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google delivers in real time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is the best at providing personalized results. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is free.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenAI</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenAI has been developed by OpenAI. AI (artificial intelligence) is a chatbot. This chatbot is a human chatting with another human. Humans can interact in the same way that this chatbot can. It would be best if you typed your question, it you and provide get an answer</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChatGPT sometimes lacks diversity in responses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main disadvantage of ChatGPT is that it is limited by data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChatGPT has serious accuracy issues.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code debugging is another great feature of ChatGPT that should not be overlooked.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes text requests and generates human-like responses to questions in few well known</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatgpt works as Google intended, but the two platforms are fundamentally different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chat Gpt is an AI bot that excels at natural language processing (NLP) and human-like responses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is a search engine that retrieves information related to your query from billions of websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google search engine is better in terms of quality and accuracy of answers. It has matured over time, with more accurate and localized results for countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chat GPT is a new product that provides simple and clear answers in an easy-to-read format. It provides simple answers more concisely. Chat GPT knows nothing about a data model limited to 2021. This means that Chat GPT doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chat GPT cannot compare messages with other complete or recent messages because it does not have access to the Internet. So the knowledge about Chat GPT is limited. It is only accessible during training</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chat GPT is currently free to use, but Open AI will monetize it sooner or later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After all, creating responses to text requests requires a lot of resources. When Elon Musk asked the CEO of OpenAI, Alex Altman replied that each request costs about a penny.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is a search engine and does not have the same language processing capabilities as ChatGPTA. I told you earlier that ChatGPTs main appeal is its human interaction. Google does not give you a single answer but gives you a different result and leaves it up to the user to answer as accurately as possible.if you’re new in any profession if you read a couple of various types of articles &amp; blogs then you get the idea about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While googling “you’re boss of yourself” because is in your hands</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In contrast, ChatGPT provides comprehensive and clear answers to your questions in human language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChatGPT admits that it occasionally provides incorrect answers. This may seem like a minor error, but it means a lot. If you doubt the validity of ChatGPT, you should look elsewhere for awesome information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is also useful for certain types of questions, as it searches the web and returns a brief but concise answer right in line. For example, if you search &#8220;Apple stock ticker&#8221; or &#8220;Cheap flights to Aruba,&#8221; it will display a ticker chart with current price information, or a calendar with the most likely cheapest days to fly and a dialogue box that connects you to multiple web sites to shop for tickets on your chosen date. ChatGPT does not search the internet in real time and has only been trained on data up to 2021, making it completely useless for these types of queries.</span></p>
<h5><b>Reasons why people stay away from Chat GPT</b></h5>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Source for the Result Text-Only Result</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slow No Query Suggestions Factual Errors </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User sometimes can&#8217;t search for products which aren&#8217;t connected to the internet at all</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks in part to its hegemony with Apple (which permits it to be the default search engine on iOS with hefty payments every year in a deal under scrutiny by the US antitrust), Google search has been winning across all platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Google provides multiple results for each query and allows users to select relevant information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Google uses sophisticated algorithms to index and rank web pages that provide accurate and relevant results</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is also extremely dependable, owing to the company&#8217;s large operations budget and years of experience. ChatGPT is still in beta testing and occasionally goes down.The strength of ChatGPT comes in its awareness of human language and ability to produce a response based on millions of pages of text.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is a multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products. It provides search engine, online advertising technologies, cloud computing, software, and hardware solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChatGPT is an AI language model developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning to generate human-like text responses. It is capable of answering a wide range of questions and generating text for various applications, including conversation, summarization, and language translation.</span></p>
<h6><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, Google is a technology giant that offers a range of products and services related to the internet, while ChatGPT is an AI language model that can generate human-like text for various use cases.</span></h6>

<h3>Define the role of a data scientist.</h3>
<h4><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-17484 alignright" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-3.png" alt="Define the role of Data Scientist " width="449" height="449" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-3.png 540w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-3-300x300.png 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-3-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /></h4>
<p>Data scientists are in high demand in the job market. This is due to their ability to make sense of large amounts of data and turn that data into actionable insights.</p>
<p>Data Scientists analyse large amounts of raw information to find patterns that will help improve our company &amp; build data products to extract valuable business insights. In this role, you should be highly analytical with a knack for analysis, math, and statistics.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Excellent problem-solving skills.</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Data scientists need to be able to find solutions to problems that have never been solved before. They need to be able to think critically and come up with new solutions to problems that have been encountered before.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h4>Excellent modelling and data analysis skills.</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A data scientist is responsible for developing and managing data-driven solutions. They work with a variety of data sources to identify trends and make informed decisions. They also use data to improve business processes and decision-making.</p>
<h3>Data scientists need to be able to understand data in a way</h3>
<p>To become a data scientist, you will need to have strong analytical and mathematical skills. You should be able to understand and work with complex data sets. Additionally, you should be able to use statistical software packages and be familiar with programming languages such as Python or R.</p>
<p>Data scientists typically have a broad background in math and statistics, but they also often have experience working in other fields where they are required to analyze large amounts of data and make decisions based on what they see. In fact, the term “data scientist” is often used interchangeably with “statistician&#8221; or “analyst”.</p>
<p>At its core, data science involves using quantitative techniques like statistical modelling, machine learning, and visualization tools to solve real-world problems. A typical day for a data scientist at an organization might involve:</p>
<p>Analyzing large datasets (e.g., social media posts) from multiple sources (e.g., news articles).</p>
<p>Implementing predictive models based on historical data sets (e.g., weather forecasts).</p>
<p>Presenting results from the analysis, including visualizations of results that provide insights into patterns in the data set (e.g., heatmaps highlighting where people are tweeting about politics). Finally, the data scientists need to know how to use statistical software packages such as SPSS and Excel. They should also know how to program in either Python or R (or both).</p>
<h4>Discuss the different types of data scientists.</h4>
<p>There are many different types of data scientists, each with their unique skill sets and abilities. Here are few types of data scientists:</p>
<p>1) Data Scientist as Statistician.</p>
<p>2) Data Scientist as Mathematician.</p>
<p>3) Data Scientists as Data Engineers.</p>
<p>4) Data Scientists as Machine Learning Scientists.</p>
<p>5) Data Scientist as Actuarial Scientist.</p>
<p>6) Data Scientists as Business Analytic Practitioners.</p>
<p>7) Data Scientist as Software Programming Analysts</p>
<p>8) Spatial Data Scientist</p>
<p>9) Data Scientist as Digital Analytic Consultant</p>
<p>10) Data Scientist as Quality Analyst</p>
<h4>Data Scientist Salaries</h4>
<p>According to Robert Half Technology’s 2022 Salary Guide, data scientists earn an average annual salary between $105,750 and $180,250 per year. However, can vary depending on location. For example, average salaries in cities across the United States include:</p>
<p>San Francisco: $121,836</p>
<p>Seattle: $108,399</p>
<p>New York: $101,387</p>
<p>Boston: $101,064</p>
<p>Los Angeles: $99,014</p>
<p>Austin: $96,495</p>
<p>Additionally, as data scientists gain experience, they often move into more senior positions with higher pay. These include:</p>
<p>Senior Data Scientist: $125,925</p>
<p>Data Science Manager: $135,401</p>
<p>Data Science Director: $157,273</p>
<h4>Essential Data Science Skills</h4>
<p>Most data scientists use the following core skills in their daily work:</p>
<p><strong>Statistical analysis:</strong> Identify patterns in data. This includes having a keen sense of pattern detection and anomaly detection.</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning:</strong> Implement algorithms and statistical models to enable a computer to automatically learn from data.</p>
<p><strong>Computer science:</strong> Apply the principles of artificial intelligence, database systems, human/computer interaction, numerical analysis, and software engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Programming:</strong> programs and analyse large datasets to uncover answers to complex problems. Data scientists need to be comfortable writing code working in a variety of languages such as Java, R, Python, and SQL.</p>
<p><strong>Data storytelling:</strong> Communicate actionable insights using data, often for a non-technical audience.</p>
