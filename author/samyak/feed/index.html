			<p>These days, we find geeks all over talking about Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, these concepts have become a homely affair lately.  While these technologies always existed around us impacting our day-to day-day lives in one way or another, we have now been made aware of the nitty-gritty of how greatly they affect us.  I figured out Data Science may be the womb of all the other contemporary science forms.</p>
<p>Data Science is a concept of combining statistics, data analytics, machine learning and such other techniques in order to understand and analyse the actual phenomenon and predict future insights. It is said that Data is the new Oil of Industrial Engine. It has to be manipulated and analysed to get the most out of it. Learning such art is indeed the most challenging and amazing journey.</p>
<p>Data Science has an impact on each and every action of mankind in this world. It is the study which leads to the maximum interaction with the people. Just imagine how great it would be if you are able to predict what a customer is going to buy in his next shopping trip based on his past buying patterns. Companies are now able to understand if the launch of a particular product will bring them profits, just by analysing the past data about their customer’s buying patterns. That’s how powerful Data Science is!</p>
<p>Our professor during a lecture told us that, “rather than Data being the new Oil, it is the new water – it can flow freely anywhere just like water”. I believe this course will teach me the most powerful skill of manipulating and analysing data.</p>
<p>Learning such a course at B.Sc. level is a wonderful opportunity for me at School of Data Science and Business Intelligence conferred by Mumbai University at Patkar-Varde College. With such a powerful base I am sure I will be able to master all other related fields and contribute to this tech generation in the best possible way!</p>
