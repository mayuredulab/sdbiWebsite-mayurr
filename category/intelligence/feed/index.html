										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A change has occurred not only from television to Netflix but also in live-streamed platforms like Tik Tok to Instagram Reels. Artificial intelligence, or AI, has been the most recent revolution, period. The &#8220;BARD&#8221; announcement by Google is undoubtedly a turning point in the AI period, which actually began a few years ago, but open AI indicated a shift with Chatgpt and expedited Google&#8217;s <strong>&#8220;BIG MOVES.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search giant has confirmed that it will soon begin public testing of its new AI chatbot, called Bard based on the company&#8217;s ” Language Model for Conversational Applications (LaMDA)”. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, also discussed the addition of artificial intelligence tools to Google Search. It should be noted that Lambda is currently only being tested in a small number of the company&#8217;s Demo Kitchen app customers. What precisely are BARDs, and why did Google decide to introduce this new technology at such short notice? A talking chatbot named Bard is based on Google and LaMDA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Google makes the experimental AI conversation service more broadly accessible to the public, Sundar Pichai stated that it will be made available to trusted testers in the upcoming weeks.</span></p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s look more closely at the purpose for this declaration.</strong></p>
<p><b>Why has Google announced Bard?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This proclamation must be understood. Microsoft is getting ready to reveal ChatGPT&#8217;s inclusion in its Bing search engine. Days before Google&#8217;s own AI presentation, Microsoft announced a fascinating event. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman poses with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella earlier this month. Microsoft has already made a $10 billion investment in OpenAI this year, and incorporating ChatGPT into Bing will cause significant problems for Google and its primary search operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be true that Google pioneered transformer technology, but it&#8217;s too late to change AI at this point. In many aspects, ChatGPT is referred to as the &#8220;demise of Google Search&#8221; because it can offer AI voice for lengthy articles and occasionally quite elegant user-question responses. Of course, nothing is perfect, but AI needs to learn how to get better and fix errors.</span></p>
<p><b>What is Bard and when can I access it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LaMDA and Google&#8217;s own AI conversational chatbot serve as the foundation for Bard. A conversational chatbot named Bard is built on Google and &#8220;Lambda.&#8221; Before Google makes its conversational AI service more broadly accessible to the public, Pichai is calling it a &#8220;experimental&#8221; service that will be offered to trusted testers in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you are wondering how to sign up for it, Remember that it is not yet accessible to the general public. LaMDA has been under testing for about two years, and Bards release is actually happening much faster than that, given the cautious and methodical approach Google has taken with LaMDA. Bard makes an effort to offer insightful, distinctive responses. In brief, it provides in-depth discussions and responses in the form of essays, much like ChatGPT does currently. The user can ask Bard to explain recent scientific findings from NASA&#8217;s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old youngster or find out more about the top soccer players of the present and then perform drills to develop his skills.</span></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:- </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has stated that it intends to integrate AI capabilities into search results. You can rapidly comprehend the big picture and learn more from other websites, such as blogs, thanks to AI-powered search capabilities that translate complex facts and multiple points of view into easy formats.  Playing the same piano and guitar,   How to locate or incorporate views in topic files. Once more, these functionalities will be available soon. This means that when searching for information on Google in the future you can expect snippets of information gleaned from blogs or articles</span></p>

			<p>Ever since I was 5, I had multiple aspirations as to what I’d want to be when I would be an adult, although unlike all my fellow classmates it was not be an astronaut or an engineer even the creative side in me was quite dead, I developed inclination towards things but eventually I’d grown out of it. I was never a fanatic or a pedantic with the things I liked, they’d all get monotonous at some point. Things changed when my father introduced me to Artificial intelligence, so I share credit with him for my crazy obsession.</p>

			<p>AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions, crazy right so it’s basically a human brain minus the human error. Most people think of AI as robots, that’s because all the movies and novels depict AI as robots that could wreak havoc on earth, that’s actually far from the truth, AI is simply designed to understand and mimic human actions, responses for efficient problem solving.</p>
<p>Today AI is used in almost every sector of life from Banking to Healthcare providing advancement in these fields. Social media, which I’m sure most of you are aware of uses Artificial intelligence to curate the contents as per our interests and filters out the friend suggestions, even Clickbait! Other basic applications of AI are self-driving cars, GPS, Cortana, Siri Amazon Echo. The current AI is the narrow or the weak AI which is used for basic simulations, the general AI is designed to perform every cognitive task. The third and the coolest AI is the ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) which is an aspect of intelligence which is more powerful and sophisticated than a human’s intelligence. ASI will outperform the human brain and will be able to generate responses and answer questions which might be beyond us humans.</p>
<p>AI has grown exponentially in the past decade, and so have the career opportunities as an AI expert/specialist. The basic skills required to build a career in AI are Sound Mathematical and Algorithmic Understanding, Basic Know-How of Programming Languages, Robotics, Data science and machine learning.</p>
<p>But like the famous American idiom, every coin has two sides AI might be a threat if it&#8217;s designed in the destructive manner. Building autonomous weapons using artificial intelligence are basically systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could easily cause mass casualties. AI could be programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive method for achieving its goal: This can happen whenever we fail to fully align the AI’s goals with ours, which is strikingly difficult.</p>
<p>The above points paint a hazy picture as to what AI could really have in store in the future. But one can definitely say that AI is a violent delight.</p>
