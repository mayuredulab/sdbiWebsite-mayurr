										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s rapidly evolving digital landscape, the world is generating an unprecedented amount of data. This data holds enormous potential to drive innovation, solve complex problems, and improve decision-making processes. As such, there is a growing need for skilled professionals who can extract valuable insights from this data &#8211; enter the data scientist. Data scientists possess the unique ability to analyze, interpret, and communicate data-driven findings, making them indispensable assets in our increasingly data-driven world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world needs more data scientists, including women, to harness the growing volume of data and unlock its potential across various industries. As mentioned earlier, data scientists play a crucial role in analyzing, interpreting, and communicating valuable insights from large datasets. By promoting gender diversity and encouraging more women to enter the field, we can ensure a broader range of perspectives and ideas, leading to more innovative and effective solutions. Additionally, having more women data scientists helps reduce biases in data-driven decision-making and contributes to a more equitable and inclusive workforce, ultimately benefiting the diverse world we live in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data science is a fantastic career choice for women, but it can be tricky to get started. The good news is that there are many reasons why women are making great strides in the field. Here’s what we know about why data science is a great career choice for women and how to get started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A growing number of women are becoming data scientists and tech leaders, but they face some serious roadblocks along the way. Here are some of the major issues women face in a male-dominated industry, and strategies they can use to overcome their human resources, business, administration, information technology, marketing, advertising, and sales.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organize datasets and identify meaningful patterns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build algorithms and design experiments to extract data to benefit the wider organization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create clear reports that visualize and communicate data insights in a business</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use machine learning tools and statistical techniques to produce actionable solutions to problems</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use insights to locate business opportunities in various departments, like marketing or HR</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mathematics and computer science are two of the strongest prerequisites for a successful career in data science. Fortunately, there is a growing number of communities for women who want to break into these areas. For example, Women Who Code sponsors women’s coding workshops and support groups throughout the country. At this point, there&#8217;s enough interest in starting these types of spaces that companies such as Google and Facebook have been forced to start their own initiatives to encourage women to pursue careers in data science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17625" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Join-s-to-support-diversity-in-STEM..jpg" alt="" width="1175" height="985" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Join-s-to-support-diversity-in-STEM..jpg 1175w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Join-s-to-support-diversity-in-STEM.-300x251.jpg 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Join-s-to-support-diversity-in-STEM.-1024x858.jpg 1024w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Join-s-to-support-diversity-in-STEM.-768x644.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1175px) 100vw, 1175px" />Female working statistics will continue to rise with more women becoming interested in data science, but still, the number of men coming into the field is greater. The biggest barrier for women entering data science is the perception that this field requires technical expertise in math and computer programming. While there are many specializations and roles within data science, including those that run on hardware, basic statistics can be done using Excel or python</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data scientists work in a variety of industries, including accounting and finance, Women in data science are essential in a data-driven world. We cannot accept large gender gaps where women are underrepresented, especially in industries that promise to change the world in such monumental ways. Women in statistics and data science will help prevent statistical bias, offer unique perspectives, and enjoy the benefits of a high-paying career path with a positive job outlook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data scientists and statisticians are in high demand, but the number of women available for the job is limited. As more and more people are relying on data to make decisions, we need more women working in this field, as they can help prevent bias and offer unique perspectives. The work being done by women in statistics and data science is paramount to achieving any goal.<br />
</span></p>
<h1>Data Science: Where Women Lead the Way to Tomorrow</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of women in data science depends on women who not only occupy roles in the industry but excel in executive roles and leadership positions in the data science and analytics space. Women in data science positions need education and confidence to pursue influential leadership positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversation about women in data science and the gender gap in technology has largely discussed the dangers of male-dominated workplace culture, the lack of mentorship provided to women, and the misconceptions about what it’s like to work in data, however, researchers are now examining how a lack of confidence is a major obstacle for women in statistics and data science.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Why Is Data Science a Fantastic Career Choice for Women?</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17621 alignnone" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Why-is-Data-Science-Fantastic-Career.jpg" alt="" width="746" height="420" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Why-is-Data-Science-Fantastic-Career.jpg 1920w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Why-is-Data-Science-Fantastic-Career-300x169.jpg 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Why-is-Data-Science-Fantastic-Career-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Why-is-Data-Science-Fantastic-Career-768x432.jpg 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Why-is-Data-Science-Fantastic-Career-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" /></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and foremost reasons that come to mind when discussing data science as a positive career choice are the widely heard promises of high pay and job growth. Indeed, looking at the data on Glassdoor (put together by a data scientist, no doubt), Data Scientist salary in India ranges between ₹ 3.6 Lakhs to ₹ 25.0 Lakhs with an average annual salary of ₹ 12.7 Lakhs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data science is a fast-growing field that allows you to work in an analytical role with data as your tool to get insights and solve problems. In this role, you have the privilege of making systems, technologies, and even products based on analysis. A career in data science will provide you with a wide range of opportunities, such as self-driven career growth, working with cutting-edge technology and tools, learning from the best people in different fields, and gaining skills that are applicable to other sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Female data scientists are in huge demand. This is due to the vast number of qualifications women (and men) can gain through data science degrees. There&#8217;s also a distinct image of what you might expect a female data scientist to look like—either a chick wearing hoodies or nerdy glasses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you want to start or progress your career. In this post, I&#8217;m going to explain why being a female data scientist is an ideal choice for you and why it can open up multiple opportunities for success.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.  The field of data science needs you.</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17619 alignright" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Field-of-Data-Science-Needs-You.jpg" alt="" width="411" height="231" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Field-of-Data-Science-Needs-You.jpg 1920w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Field-of-Data-Science-Needs-You-300x169.jpg 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Field-of-Data-Science-Needs-You-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Field-of-Data-Science-Needs-You-768x432.jpg 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Field-of-Data-Science-Needs-You-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px" /></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A new report on the gender balance in this multi-billion-dollar industry released by the Institute for Women and Technology (IWT) and McKinsey &amp; Company shows that data science is making significant progress toward becoming more diverse, but a lack of women persists. More than half of all data scientists are men.  “This is not an anomaly, it’s a systemic problem,” said Diana Frank, senior vice president at McKinsey</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gender imbalance in data science is a growing problem. The field of data science needs more women and since you are here today, you can be part of the solution!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons to become a data scientist, but the main one is that it&#8217;s a fantastic way to further your education and career in your field of interest. The skills that you learn while becoming a data scientist can help you break into any field possible. Data science proves itself as a highly lucrative career choice for women who dare to take it on and achieve success in this male-dominated industry.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Women’s Biggest Barriers and How to Overcome Them</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17622 alignleft" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Women-Biggest-Barrierss.jpg" alt="" width="527" height="297" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Women-Biggest-Barrierss.jpg 1920w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Women-Biggest-Barrierss-300x169.jpg 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Women-Biggest-Barrierss-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Women-Biggest-Barrierss-768x432.jpg 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Women-Biggest-Barrierss-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also now be experiencing some degree of self-doubt, as is common for women in this situation. Indeed, this doubt remains one of the biggest barriers still preventing or hindering many women from entering the field. But it doesn’t have to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a large industry, where representation is still lagging behind what researchers had expected based on the rapidly increasing number of women entering STEM and related fields, one could say that Women’s Biggest Barriers and How to Overcome Them is a must-read. In fact, many women still face a lot of roadblocks in becoming an ever more prominent force in software development and technology-related fields (engineering, programming). If you are one of them, it’s time to take a step back and look at this book as a platform for growth — not only yours but also for other women who might be interested in learning about coding or pursuing a data science degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the truth is – those are justifications of fear and thus complete nonsense. Our brains are very powerful at making excuses for us all &#8212; even when trying to stick with a new exercise routine or a healthier diet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of us think that we can’t enter or excel at certain careers because of our personal circumstances, including gender and age. But this thinking has no basis in facts or research — in fact, it’s holding women back from seeing their full potential. Our brains are very good at justifying our thoughts and feelings — so instead of letting these barriers get in the way every time we try something new, let’s use them as motivation to overcome doubt and embrace opportunities!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons why women find it difficult to enter the field of Data Science. A lot of barriers can be related to cultural issues, education, and a lack of awareness about the roles available in data science fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women’s biggest barrier to becoming data scientists is the lack of role models in the field. There are so few women that it is hard for them to find role models and mentors, which leads to more discouragement. Women also face issues when their workplace cultures don’t consider them as experts and value their contributions as much as their male colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data science is a field that’s quickly becoming a leading way to solve problems. Data scientists are responsible for evolving the way we do things, whether it’s understanding how people use technology and then figuring out how to make this technology better by learning from them, exploring new ways to analyze information in people’s lives, or even learning from data itself. For example, one of your jobs as a data scientist could be to figure out ways for a company like Facebook to encourage users to use more of its services. We’re using social media—known as the Facebook News Feed algorithm update process—so that we can get the most engagement possible while reducing spammy comments. While there are many types of roles you might end up serving in your career as a data scientist, no matter what type of role you end up playing, there are two skills that every good data scientist should have: analyzing and organizing data.</span></p>

With intense competition and exceptional talent on display, it&#8217;s a cricket tournament like no other. But with so many variables at play, accurately predicting the winner can be a challenging task. That&#8217;s where machine learning comes in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to train computers to learn from data and generate predictions based on that knowledge is known as machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence. These algorithms can analyze historical information such as teams, players, and match outcomes, in the case of IPL win prediction in order to spot patterns and trends that indicate which team is most likely to win.</span></p>
<p><b>Machine Learning Algorithm<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-17563 alignleft" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Machine-learning-algorithm.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="327" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Machine-learning-algorithm.jpg 800w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Machine-learning-algorithm-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Machine-learning-algorithm-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px" /></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The capacity of machine learning to take into account a huge variety of factors that might influence a match&#8217;s outcome is what makes it unique. Machine learning algorithms may consider anything from prior team performances and player forms to pitch conditions and even weather forecasts. This enables predictions that are more precise than those made merely on the basis of human intuition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Data Collection and Cleaning</b></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17564 alignright" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Data-Collection-and-Cleaning.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="149" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Data-Collection-and-Cleaning.jpg 509w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Data-Collection-and-Cleaning-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we have a clean dataset, it&#8217;s time to select the best machine learning method. There are several choices, including logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. The decision is based on the size, complexity, and level of accuracy that are sought for the dataset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After choosing an algorithm, we proceed to train our machine learning model. In order to do this, the data must be split into training and testing sets. While the testing set assesses the model&#8217;s accuracy, the training set teaches the algorithm to recognize patterns and trends. We make the model more accurate until it reaches the target degree of accuracy.</span></p>
<p><b>Visuals of Model Training</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-17565" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Visuals-of-Model-Training.webp" alt="" width="534" height="300" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Visuals-of-Model-Training.webp 1920w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Visuals-of-Model-Training-300x169.webp 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Visuals-of-Model-Training-1024x576.webp 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px" />Our model is now prepared to perform its magic! Our machine learning algorithm predicts the most probable winning side once we enter the pertinent information, including team names, players, pitch conditions, and even the weather forecast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s crucial to remember that machine learning is not a precise science. The projections will always be subject to some degree of uncertainty. The accuracy is a function of the model&#8217;s complexity, the quality and completeness of the data, and the data itself. The results of matches may also be influenced by additional aspects that the data or the model may not have considered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, machine learning has the potential to be an effective technique for forecasting IPL game results. These algorithms give us predictions that are more accurate than those we would get from our intuition alone by looking at previous data and seeing patterns and trends. They serve as a guide for cricket enthusiasts, assisting us in making more educated choices on our preferred IPL teams and players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
Machine learning is a powerful tool for predicting IPL match outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By analyzing historical data and uncovering patterns and trends, machine learning algorithms provide more accurate predictions than intuition alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it&#8217;s essential to understand the limitations of machine learning and use the predictions as a guide rather than a guarantee.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the right approach, machine learning empowers cricket fans to make more informed predictions about their favorite teams and players in the IPL tournament.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So embrace the potential of machine learning and enhance your IPL experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until then, happy cricketing!</span></p>

In fact, the term “data scientist” is often used interchangeably with “statistician&#8221; or “analyst”.</p>
<p>At its core, data science involves using quantitative techniques like statistical modelling, machine learning, and visualization tools to solve real-world problems. A typical day for a data scientist at an organization might involve:</p>
<p>Analyzing large datasets (e.g., social media posts) from multiple sources (e.g., news articles).</p>
<p>Implementing predictive models based on historical data sets (e.g., weather forecasts).</p>
<p>Presenting results from the analysis, including visualizations of results that provide insights into patterns in the data set (e.g., heatmaps highlighting where people are tweeting about politics). Finally, the data scientists need to know how to use statistical software packages such as SPSS and Excel. They should also know how to program in either Python or R (or both).</p>
<h4>Discuss the different types of data scientists.</h4>
<p>There are many different types of data scientists, each with their unique skill sets and abilities. Here are few types of data scientists:</p>
<p>1) Data Scientist as Statistician.</p>
<p>2) Data Scientist as Mathematician.</p>
<p>3) Data Scientists as Data Engineers.</p>
<p>4) Data Scientists as Machine Learning Scientists.</p>
<p>5) Data Scientist as Actuarial Scientist.</p>
<p>6) Data Scientists as Business Analytic Practitioners.</p>
<p>7) Data Scientist as Software Programming Analysts</p>
<p>8) Spatial Data Scientist</p>
<p>9) Data Scientist as Digital Analytic Consultant</p>
<p>10) Data Scientist as Quality Analyst</p>
<h4>Data Scientist Salaries</h4>
<p>According to Robert Half Technology’s 2022 Salary Guide, data scientists earn an average annual salary between $105,750 and $180,250 per year. However, can vary depending on location. For example, average salaries in cities across the United States include:</p>
<p>San Francisco: $121,836</p>
<p>Seattle: $108,399</p>
<p>New York: $101,387</p>
<p>Boston: $101,064</p>
<p>Los Angeles: $99,014</p>
<p>Austin: $96,495</p>
<p>Additionally, as data scientists gain experience, they often move into more senior positions with higher pay. These include:</p>
<p>Senior Data Scientist: $125,925</p>
<p>Data Science Manager: $135,401</p>
<p>Data Science Director: $157,273</p>
<h4>Essential Data Science Skills</h4>
<p>Most data scientists use the following core skills in their daily work:</p>
<p><strong>Statistical analysis:</strong> Identify patterns in data. This includes having a keen sense of pattern detection and anomaly detection.</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning:</strong> Implement algorithms and statistical models to enable a computer to automatically learn from data.</p>
<p><strong>Computer science:</strong> Apply the principles of artificial intelligence, database systems, human/computer interaction, numerical analysis, and software engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Programming:</strong> programs and analyse large datasets to uncover answers to complex problems. Data scientists need to be comfortable writing code working in a variety of languages such as Java, R, Python, and SQL.</p>
<p><strong>Data storytelling:</strong> Communicate actionable insights using data, often for a non-technical audience.</p>
<p>Data scientists play a key role in helping organizations make sound decisions. As such, they need “soft skills” in the following areas.</p>
<p><strong>Business intuition</strong>: Connect with stakeholders to gain a full understanding of the problems they’re looking to solve.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical thinking:</strong> Find analytical solutions to abstract business issues.</p>
<p><strong>Critical thinking</strong>: Apply objective analysis of facts before concluding.</p>
<p><strong>Inquisitiveness:</strong> Look beyond what’s on the surface to discover patterns and solutions within the data.</p>
<p><strong>Interpersonal skills:</strong> Communicate with a diverse audience across all levels of an organization.</p>
<h6>Conclusion:</h6>
<p>So, after knowing what exactly Data Science is and why it&#8217;s important, you have to explore further. So, data has become the fuel of industries. Companies use data to function, grow, and improve their businesses. Although the industry of data science is fairly new, it is already a major player in many industries. Data has become a vital resource for companies, and data scientists are essential to its success. “The goal is to turn data into information and information into insight”</p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Augmented Reality</span></li>
</ol>
<h5></h5>
<h5>1.Internet search</h5>
<h5><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-17430 alignleft" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Internet-search-300x300.png" alt="" width="215" height="215" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Internet-search-300x300.png 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Internet-search-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Internet-search-150x150.png 150w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Internet-search-768x768.png 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Internet-search.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when we speak of search engines,  we think of google, right, but there are many other search engines like google which are Yahoo, Bing, Ask, etc. All these search engines including Google make use of data science algorithms to deliver the best result for our search query in a fractional second. Conserving the fact that Google processes more than 20 petabytes of data every day, had there been no data science, Google wouldn’t have been the google we know today. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.Digital Advertisement/Targeted Advertising </span></h5>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17416 alignright" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/digital-advertising-hed-2016-290x300.png" alt="" width="206" height="214" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/digital-advertising-hed-2016-290x300.png 290w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/digital-advertising-hed-2016.png 652w" sizes="(max-width: 206px) 100vw, 206px" /></span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you thought that the searching would have been the biggest application of Data Science &amp; Machine learning, here is a challenger. The entire digital marketing spectrum starts from the display of banners on various websites to the digital billboard at the airport. Almost all are decided by using Data Science Algorithms; this is the reason why digital ads have been able to get a much higher CTR compared to a traditional advertisement. They can be targeted based on the user&#8217;s past behavior. This is the reason why I see ads for analytics training while my friends see ads for apparel in the same place at the same time.</span></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.Website Recommendation </span></h5>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-17419 alignleft" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0_EGZN5hwmmW9RS-Ia-300x114.png" alt="Website Recommendation" width="300" height="114" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0_EGZN5hwmmW9RS-Ia-300x114.png 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0_EGZN5hwmmW9RS-Ia-1024x389.png 1024w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0_EGZN5hwmmW9RS-Ia-768x292.png 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0_EGZN5hwmmW9RS-Ia.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You upload your image with a friend on Facebook &amp; you start getting suggestion tags from your friend. This automatic tag suggestion feature uses a face recognition algorithm, similarly while using WhatsApp web you scan barcodes in your web browser using your mobile phone. In addition, Google provides you the option to search for images by uploading them. it uses image recognition &amp; provides related search results.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">5.Speech recognition </span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-17421 alignleft" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Speech-Recogniztion-300x150.png" alt="" width="300" height="150" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Speech-Recogniztion-300x150.png 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Speech-Recogniztion-768x384.png 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Speech-Recogniztion.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the best speech recognition products are Google Voice, SIRI, Alexa, etc. Using this speech recognition feature even if you aren’t in a position to type a msg your life wouldn’t stop simply speaking out the msg &amp; it will convert into text. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.Airline Route Planning </span></h5>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17422 alignright" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boarding-Pass-NYC-to-SFO-169x300.png" alt="" width="205" height="364" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boarding-Pass-NYC-to-SFO-169x300.png 169w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boarding-Pass-NYC-to-SFO-576x1024.png 576w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boarding-Pass-NYC-to-SFO-768x1365.png 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boarding-Pass-NYC-to-SFO-864x1536.png 864w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Boarding-Pass-NYC-to-SFO.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airlines across the world are known to bear heavy losses except for a few airline service providers. Companies are struggling to maintain their occupancy ratio &amp; operating profits. The high rise in air-fuel prices &amp; the need to offer heavy discounts to customers have further made the situation worse. It wasn’t long before airline companies started using Data science to identify the strategic area for improvement now using data science the airline company can predict flight delays, decide which class of airplane to buy whether to directly land at a destination or take a halt between them e.g.  a flight can have a direct route to Delhi to New York alternatively it can also halt at any other country &amp; finally effectively drive customer loyalty programs, Southwest airlines, Alaska Airline is among the top companies who embrace Data Science to bring changes in their way of working.</span></p>
<h5></h5>
<h5></h5>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.Fraud &amp; Risk Detection </span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-17423 alignleft" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fraud-Detection-2-300x188.png" alt="" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fraud-Detection-2-300x188.png 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fraud-Detection-2-768x480.png 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fraud-Detection-2.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />One of the first applications of Data Science originated from the finance discipline, companies were fed up with bad debts and losses every year. However, they have a lot of data that used to get collected during the initial paperwork while sanctioning loans they decided to bring in data science practices to rescue them from losses. Over the years banking companies learn to divide &amp; conquer data while customers profile past expenditures and other essential variables to analyze the probabilities of risk in default, more ever it also happens to push the banking products, based on customer purchasing power. Apart from the applications mentioned above, data science is also used for marketing, finance, human resources, health care, government policies, and every possible industry where data gets generated. In addition to predicting the world share of customers, which customer is likely to churn, which customer should be pitched the high value of the product and many other questions can be easily answered while Data Science. </span></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.Medical Sciences</span></h5>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-17424 alignleft" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/medical-science-278x300.jpg" alt="" width="278" height="300" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/medical-science-278x300.jpg 278w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/medical-science-948x1024.jpg 948w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/medical-science-768x829.jpg 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/medical-science.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Health care center has perceived great benefits from Data Science applications.  A few of them include Medical Image Analysis, so there has been lots of research in this area &amp; one of the major studies in Big Data Analytics in healthcare was published in biomedical research International.  According to this study,  popular imaging techniques such as MRI, X-Ray, computed tomography &amp; so on. Numerous methods have been used to tackle the difference in modernity resolution &amp; invention of these images. Many more are being developed to improve the image quality, extract data from images more efficiently and provide the most accurate interpretation now the deep learning-based algorithms increase the Diagnostic accuracy by learning from the previous examples and then suggest better treatment solutions.</span></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Genetics &amp; Genomics</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-17425 alignright" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Genetic-genomics-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Genetic-genomics-300x199.jpg 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Genetic-genomics.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The genetics research enabled an advanced level of treatment personalization; they used MapReduce which allows reading genetic semen mapping  &amp; shortens the time for efficient Data processing. The goal is to understand the impact of DNA on health &amp; find an individual biological connection between genetics, diseases &amp; drug response. Deep genomics made a remarkable impact on the prediction of molecular effects on genetic variation essential to DNA interpretation &amp; this would not have been possible without their database which enabled the scientist to understand how genetic variations can impact the genetic code. </span></p>
<h5></h5>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creation of Drugs </span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-17426 alignleft" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drug-Medicine-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drug-Medicine-300x169.jpg 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drug-Medicine-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drug-Medicine-768x432.jpg 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drug-Medicine-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drug-Medicine-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The Drugs Discovery process is highly complicated and involves many disciplines. The greatest ideas are often bounded by billions of testing huge financial and time expenditures. On average it takes 12 years to get a drug officially submitted. The data science and machine learning algorithms simplify and shorten this process adding a perspective to each step from the initial screening of drug compounds to the prediction of success rates based on biological factors Such algorithms can forecast how the compounds will act in a body using advanced Mathematical Modeling and Simulations instead of lab experiments. The idea behind computational drug Discovery is to create a computer model simulation as a biological relevant network simplifying the prediction of future outcomes with high accuracy. It allows choosing which experiments should be done and incorporates all new information in a continuous learning look.<br />

<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual Assistance for Patients Optimus </span></h5>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-17427 alignleft" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Virtual-Assistance-Support-300x157.jpg" alt="" width="388" height="203" data-wp-editing="1" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Virtual-Assistance-Support-300x157.jpg 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Virtual-Assistance-Support-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Virtual-Assistance-Support-768x401.jpg 768w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Virtual-Assistance-Support.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /></span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The optimization of the clinical processes buildup on the concept that in many cases patients don&#8217;t need to visit doctors in person. So, using a mobile application can give a much more effective solution by bringing the doctor to the patient instead now the AI the powered mobile apps can provide basic Healthcare support usually as chatbots are simply described your symptoms or ask questions and then receive key information about your medical condition derived from a wide network of linking symptoms to causes. Apps can remind you to take your medicine on time and if missed it took an appointment with a doctor. This approach promotes a healthy lifestyle by encouraging patients to make healthy decisions, save that time on waiting in line for an appointment, and allows doctors to focus on more critical cases now this machine-learning algorithm uses natural language processing and generation to provide current information. This way the most appropriate customer support is to create would obviously cannot fully rely on machines in the Healthcare and that&#8217;s why it uses the wide database that is available in the healthcare department. </span></p>

<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 9.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaming</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-17428 alignleft" src="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gaming-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gaming-300x200.png 300w, https://sdbi.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gaming.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EA Sports, Zynga,  Sony, &amp;  Activision Blizzard have led the gaming experience to the next level using data science. Games are now designed using machine learning algorithms which improve &amp;  upgrade themselves as the players move up to a higher level. In Motional gaming also, your opponent analyses your previous moves &amp; accordingly shapes up the game. Now, this would not have been possible without Data science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example the high trending game of Pokémon Go, the ability to walk around things and locate Pokémon on walls and grounds, things that aren&#8217;t there, brilliant. The views in the last app from the same company are the data that helps to choose the locations of Pokémon Gems etc. Talking of which this is also the application that I am most excited about in the future.</span></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">10.Augmented reality </span></h5>

However data science makes more sense once the VR economy becomes accessible in terms of pricing and consumers often, like other Apps, do not know much has been revealed about them except prototypes, and neither do I know when they would be available for a common man&#8217;s disposal. We need to wait &amp; watch how far these Tech Giants can become successful in their quest to develop the perfect VR Headset or self-driving car projects &amp; other futuristic designs.</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let&#8217;s see what the future holds for us.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></p>

			<p>While applying for jobs in today&#8217;s time, it&#8217;s quite common, rather obvious to have a professional <strong>CV</strong> mentioning a set of qualifications, skill sets and work experience one possesses.<br />
Undeniably, CVs play a very important role at forming an impression on a potential employer at its first glance. However, a CV in itself is not enough to help you land your <strong>dream job</strong>, what you need alongwith with your CV is a <strong>portfolio!</strong> Especially if you&#8217;re from a<strong> technological background.</strong></p>
<p>As a part of our job at <strong>SDBI,</strong> we mentor students and assist them with getting placements after their degree is completed at our institute. Something we always suggest is to have a portfolio that <strong>showcases your work</strong> at its best and makes it easy for the employer to understand your skills sets and strengths for the offered job role. It ultimately also leaves a very good impression on the employer.</p>

			<p>The behavioral model can be queried to ensure this is the case and to guide the improvement of the user journey. The product roadmap should  include a targeted data acquisition strategy, enabling more sophisticated functionalities to be validated by user interactions before being deployed more widely and lastly comes the testing stage, for a design projects, the concept of a “test and learn” loop is useful to emphasize the iterative and ongoing nature of product refinement and improvement.</p>

			<p>While there are classes of models that work well for small groups of users given sufficient domain knowledge, all data science techniques work better at scale. Data science provides the means to measure and compare our designs in an unbiased way. This can be done at different levels of design fidelity and at different resolutions of the model, from the granular feature level all the way up to the level of the overarching system, depending on the resources available for prototyping and testing design elements.</p>

			<p>By carefully interweaving design thinking, strategy and data science, businesses can achieve design solutions that are not only conceptually and experientially outstanding, but that will also succeed in the marketplace. At the end of the day, the organizations that would win will be the ones that learn how to leverage Data Science and Design Thinking to drive the business and operational focus, and align, adopt and monetize these enabling technology combinations. The principles of the design process or design thinking, can help get the most out of data science, by providing a methodology for dealing with the ambiguous and complex nature of the data science models. It can also help in ensuring that the resulting insights are actionable and valuable for stakeholders, who remain at the core of the process.</p>
